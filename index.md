### Recent Projects 

[South Park GAN's](http://www.github.com/Noah-Prowell/South_Park_GANs)
<br><br>
Implemented a retrained GPT2-small and a LSTM generative adversarial network to produce text drawn from South Park script data. I had ~10,000 lines of data per character. I then produced a discriminator to measure which GAN was better, the lower the accuracy the better the GAN. The LSTM GAN scored 100% accuracy, while the retrained GPT2 scored ~59% accuracy. My next step is to train a GPT2-large to get better generated text.

[Bird Call Identification](http://www.github.com/Noah-Prowell/Bird_call_id)
<br><br>
My data was bird call audio files and had 30-100 bird calls per species. I then converted the audio files into spectrograms and used transformations to add more images. I trained a Tensorflow CNN and in just one week, I was able to achieve 32% accuracy for five classes of bird species. This problem was made very difficult due to background noise in the spectrograms, and that the spectrograms were not very similar in each bird class. Plan to improve the model by removing background noise in the spectrograms. And implementing a transfer learning model.
