### Recent Projects

[Gym Calories Analysis](https://github.com/Noah-Prowell/gym_calories_proj)
<br><br>
*Data analysis and model to predict gym calories burned during a workout session. Implemented a linear and random forest regressor model to make predictions on 973 rows of workout data.*

[Snow Report](https://thesnowreports.com)
<br><br>
*Passion project website creating cutstom dated graphs of snow depth and snow precipitation for various areas around Colorado. Still in initial builds and will be eventually adding other features such as forecasting.*

[South Park GAN's](http://www.github.com/Noah-Prowell/South_Park_GANs)
<br><br>
*Implemented a retrained GPT2-small and a LSTM generative adversarial network to produce text drawn from South Park script data. I had ~10,000 lines of data per character. I then produced a discriminator to measure which GAN was better, the lower the accuracy the better the GAN. The LSTM GAN scored 100% accuracy, which was terrible, while the retrained GPT2 scored ~59% accuracy which was quite good. It was interesting to see what the computer would come up with and there were many funny lines that I am sure anyone would enjoy.  If you would like to learn more please click the link above.*

[Bird Call Identification](http://www.github.com/Noah-Prowell/Bird_call_id)
<br><br>
*My data was bird call audio files and had 30-100 bird calls per species. I then converted the audio files into spectrograms which contain all of the data from the audio files in an image that I can train a CNN on. I trained a Tensorflow CNN and in just one week, I was able to achieve 32% accuracy for five classes of bird species. After not being satisfied with this result I employed the use of transfer learning to improve my results.  I used the Inception-ResNet V2 model with the pretrained imagenet weights.  Using this I was able to improve my training accuracy to 99% and my validation accuracy to 60% for five classes, which is a huge improvement!  This just shows how powerful these transfer learning models are and how useful they can be.  These results were satisfactory enough for me to move onto the full 264 classes!  After training on AWS, my model was able to achieve a 96% accuracy on 264 classes!  Please click on the link if you would like to learn more.*

[Danger Mountain](https://www.github.com/Noah-Prowell/Danger-Mountain)
<br><br>
*Used avalanche data from Davos, Switzerland in the years 1998-2019 to conduct several experiments to infer avalanche sizes based on various factors such as the direction of the face and the snow type on the mountain.  Discovered on average a single increase in the difference in elevation leads to an increase in avalanche area of 199 m2.*

[Bitcoing Price Prediction](https://share.streamlit.io/noah-prowell/bitcoin_prediction/main/app.py)
<br><br>
*Used bitcoin pricing data to predict day to day whether the price will be going up or down using a random forest model with an 80% accuracy.  As well as a long term prediction using an ARIMA model that shows a 95% confidence interval.  Click the link in the title to view the live app and to make Bitcoin predictions yourself!  Also here is the full github link with more info on my project.*[GITHUB](https://github.com/Noah-Prowell/bitcoin_prediction)
